# JosCalendar
I noticed that the JCalendar library doesn't offer an actual calendar object in which you can display events and date related information in a monthly view. So I've created a class to display a monthly calendar with JTextAreas included for the display of daily information.
The class you should be interested in is JosCalendar. It works perfectly on Netbeans 13.0. You just need to add the class into your project, and instantiate the Calendar giving it a JPanel in which to appear. In the project, Ive added a button that calls the function on JosCalendar "updateCalendar". This one is the responsible for showing the proper month and information. Keep in mind, all information on the JTextAreas, unless stored, will be lost.
You dont need JCalendar. 
Any suggestions would be appreciated. Ty for checking out my code <3.
